# Naive-Bayes-Classification
Simple Naive Bayes Algorithm implementation in Python using Contact Lenses Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

As you see I didnt use any Libraries like scikit-learn at all. <br>
I tryied to make it "by hand", and it helped me a lot to undrastand the algorithm.

The project contains 4 files.<br>
1.NaiveBayesClass.py <br>
2.clenses2.txt <br>
3.contact-lenses.txt <br>
4.dataset.names <br>

Data Set Information:

The examples are complete and noise free. The examples highly simplified the problem. The attributes do not fully describe all the factors affecting the decision as to which type, if any, to fit.
Notes:

--This database is complete (all possible combinations of attribute-value pairs are represented).

--Each instance is complete and correct.

--9 rules cover the training set.

Execute:

python3 NaiveBayesClass.py

The txt named contact-lenses.txt contains all the instances of the dataset. <br>
Also the txt named clenses2.txt contains the 80% of the dataset instances and used to cover the training set. <br>
*Change the txt file if u want to see how the project responds without the full dataset.
